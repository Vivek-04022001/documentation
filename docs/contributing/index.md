# Contributing to Plone

This document gives you a high level and important overview of what and how you can contribute to Plone.

There are many ways to contribute to Plone, for example by helping others on our [Community Forum][https://community.plone.org], and if you find a bug or problem when using Plone by checking for an existing issue or filing new issues.
You can do this whether you are an end user, site administrator or developer. 
This contributing section of the documentation will focus on code, documentation, publications on our official websites and any change in our repositories on GitHub that will become part of the Plone Software or our public communication. 
It describes legal requirements, onboarding as a new contributing member, our community and developer culture, and the process we follow to work together on Plone with as less friction as possible.

## First step: granting the Plone Foundation permission to your contribution

Before you contribute, you must give permission to publish to use your contribution according to the license we use.

Legally, you can  **NOT** contribute any code, documentation or changes unless you have signed the contributor agreement.

This means that we can **NOT** accept pull requests from you unless this is done, please donâ€™t put the code reviewers at risk and try to do it anyway.

- Sign the [Plone Contributor Agreement](https://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement).

For more information and background on the reasons for and contents of the Contributor's agreemement, see our [explanation on plone.org](https://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement)

## Plone Community Developer Culture

If you are going to be contributing to Plone, we ask a couple things.
First, please join the Plone forum and at minimum lurk around.
You will quickly see how people work and what kind of things are best suited for group discussion.
Second, use our documentnation to try to set up your development environment for the part of Plone you want to contribute to. 

### First Search for existing documentation

Please first search for a solution in our documentation and on our [Community Forum](https://community.plone.org) before asking for help.
Many of our developers are active on our Forum and you will get the best advice there.
The people there have been using Plone for a while or very long time, and are happy to help you get going if you find an report an omission in our documentation.

For chat, we are using Discord. [Join the Plone Discord server](https://discord.gg/zFY3EBbjaj)
Please note that our Discord server is mostly used for online 'synchronous' activities, communication in our teams and during sprints and our Plone Conference.
It is not the preferred location for asking questions about set up, installation and other support questions that you might have. 
Discord is not indexed, archived or structured for that kind of assistance. 

### Online development is asynchronous

If you are in a timezone when things are not very active, please post to the forum or wait for people to wake up.

### Plone is run by volunteers
